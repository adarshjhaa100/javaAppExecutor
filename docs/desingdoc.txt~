Java App Launcher

Features:
    -GUI- tkinter
    -Select jdk and download
    -Set Java env variables(do we need this.. no we dont)
    -compile and execute java programs(It would be ideal if we would have a jar) 


Steps to do(for now in single process):

1. Create JDK property list(json format having name, url, sha256checksum,
storage location etc)
2. Verify if JDK already present
(done)3. Download JDK
4. verifyintegrity, and then add the download location to the JDK's property json
(done)5. extract(maybe delete the jdk zip to save space)
6. check whether java command is working
7. Select JAR file 
(done)8. Run JAR file
